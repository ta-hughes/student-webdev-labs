## Reflection Document for Taylor Hughes Lab Notebook Experience

#### Here are the Questions

- Were you able to complete the exercises on your own or did you use the videos or the solutions for help?
- How helpful did you find the exercises in this section? Was there one exercise that was particularly helpful?
- Was there something that you wish had been explained better?
- Were there other exercises that might have helped you learn this week's topic a little better?

### 01-HTML

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Folder 1 kicked off the lab notebook by introducing us to HTML. I founds it best to skip a trial and error, and since I learn best from observation, I completed all the folders by watching the provided videos. All of the practice files within this folder were helpful. I liked the `01-html/03-images.html` exercise in particular because it explained that the `href='#'` attribute for photos could be linked to a picture on the internet. That being said, the 'placekitten' website was down, so it did cause some confusion on the assignment. There was a moment of pause where I believed I was doing something incorrect, and I was rewatching the video to figure out what I did wrong, when in fact nothing was wrong on my end. I wish that was explained that there is a chance that the placekitten website could be down. I also wished there was huge emphasis on units not being allowed when specifying a height or width in an html document. I found these exercises helpful. I believe if anything additional exercises could be arranged to go into more detail in trying to utilize other semantic elements in html.

### 02-Accessability

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I learn best from observation, so I completed this folder by simply watching the provided videos. This exercise was helpful in causing me to begin taking accessibility into consideration. This exercise helped this effort. I think it was pretty clear on the main points. I do think the `<fieldset>` and `<legend>` could have been explained a little more, and when exactly to used them. Can multiple fieldsets and legends be within the same form, etc. ? I think a good way to learn about accessibility is to walk through examples where the accessibility issue needs to be found. If we are able to see an accessibility issue by stepping into someones shoes by whom a disability is being experienced, then learning about accessibility might be easier. Walking through a screen reader for example could have been helpful, and then it would have highlighted the importance of ensuring labels are properly associated with input elements.

### 03-CSS

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I learn best from observation, so I completed this folder by simply watching the provided videos. Folder 03-CSS was particularyly fun, because it made me start to feel like a webdesigner. Adding styles to html code is extremely satisfying. These exercises were very helpful in throwing us into the world of cascading style sheets. The `04-layout.css`,`05-position.css` and the `06-media-queries.css` files were of most help in this folder. These three files in particularly are key to applying CSS to an HTML document. Specificity is complicated overall, and I wish there was a way to more easily remember how to calculate specificity on your own, vs relying on vscode. The key to better learning CSS is to just practice CSS and trying out different style properties, changing them to see how the document is affected.

### 04-Flexbox & 05-CSS-Grid

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These two folder went hand in hand together, because they are two different ways of achieving similar results. I feel like Grid is not going to be used very often, at least this is the feeling from this course since it felt like so little time was dedicated to learning grid and using grid. The flexbox folder on its own was the most useful and helpful folder in this lab notebook since it helped show layout. Flexbox is a great way to align many 'cards' or containers on a page. The exercises demonstrated very well with purple boxes, the affect of flex box styles on the containers. I wish a couple more example files existed that applied flex box to more realistic looking webpages. It would be great to see it in a way similar to the second Grid exercise. With a Nav, Aside, Body and Footer, etc.

### 06-Bootstrap

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish more time was spent on Bootstrap since this can be a very useful tool in developing a prototype of a website very quickly. I like the exercise where we worked on making a module. This seems like something that will come in handy is website design.

### 07-JavaScript

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of all of the folders, the JavaScript folder was by far my favorite. I was extremely interesting to be able to manimpulate the DOM using JavaScript. I wish more time was spent on JavaScript. Especially examples pertaining to webpages and fetching. I wish multiple examples of fetching were provided from different API so that we could practice more. And an example where more than one fetch is done for a single webpage could have been advantageous. Fetching from API is complicated and took me some time to play around with the file to fully understand it. I will also say that I believe the file used in the video for exercise `04-dom` within this folder, the <div> with `class='output'` was an `'id'='output` in the video. I ended up seeking help in person, because I learn best from watching, and if I am watching what I believe to be the correct answer, then I couldn't figure out why my was not working when it was written exactly like that that had been written in the video.

### 08-jQuery

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I learn best from observation, so I completed this folder by simply watching the provided videos. These two videos on the two JavaScript files in this folder were very helpful. It tooks previous lab notebook entries and redid them using jQuery. That being said, I think it would have been helpful to perhaps have it explained when you would want to use jQuery vs JavaScript. Or should jQuery be used all the time? I also think the compressed and uncompressed jQuery files vs CDN from the slideshow lecture should be explained a bit better.
